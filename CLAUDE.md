# Claude Rules for GRIDLOCK

## Overview

GRIDLOCK is a retro tile-based RPG built with vanilla JS + HTML5 Canvas. No build step, no npm, no frameworks. Serve the root directory with any HTTP server and open `index.html`.

The game has 3 classes (Bruiser, Fixer, Hacker), tick-based combat, equipment with proc effects, a crafting system, NPC dialogue, quests, a danger meter, perks every 5 levels, an underworld death system, a monster compendium, Web Audio SFX, and an ending sequence.

**Current state:** All phases (1–8B) complete. ~70 rooms across 8 regions (Grymhold, Caves, Underworld, Sewer, Sprawl, Retail Ruins, Gym District, Labs, Consultant's Island). 5 bosses, ~40 enemy types, 8 princess quests, title screen, ending sequence with multiple endings based on princess rescue count.

## How to Run

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080
```

Save data is in localStorage under key `gridlock_save_v1`.

## Architecture

### State Machine
`main.js` has a single `state` variable switching on `GAME_STATES`. 14 states: `TITLE`, `OVERWORLD`, `TRANSITION`, `COMBAT`, `DIALOGUE`, `MENU`, `SHOP`, `DEATH`, `CLASS_SELECT`, `CRAFTING`, `PERK`, `COMPENDIUM`, `DEBUG`, `ENDING`. Each state has its own update + render path in the game loop, and key handlers in `initExtraInput()`. Game starts at `TITLE`.

### Module Pattern
All state is in module-level variables (not classes). Modules export getter functions (`getPlayer()`, `getCombat()`, etc.) returning mutable objects. No build step — ES modules loaded directly by browser.

### Circular Dependency Handling
Cross-module refs are wired via init functions called in `main.js`: `initItemsRef()`, `initPlayerRef()`, `initSpellsRef()`, `initShopSpellsRef()`, `initCharItemsRef()`, `initWorldPlayerRef()`, `initBossAiRef()`.

### Canvas Rendering
- Native resolution: 512x384 (16 cols × 12 rows, 32px tiles)
- CSS scales to 1024x768 / 1536x1152 based on viewport
- All drawing through `renderer.js` primitives; UI modules draw directly via `getCtx()`
- 8×8 pixel art sprites defined inline in `js/data/sprites.js`, pre-rendered to offscreen canvases at 4× (overworld) and 6× (combat)

### Room Format
Room JSON files live in `data/rooms/{region}/{room}.json`. Regions: `grymhold`, `caves`, `underworld`, `sewer`, `sprawl`, `retail`, `gym`, `labs`, `island`. Fields:
- `id` — matches file path (e.g., `"grymhold/town_1"`)
- `name` — display name in HUD
- `tiles` — 12×16 2D array of tile IDs (rows × cols)
- `exits` — `{ left?, right?, up?, down? }` → target room ID string, or `{ target, locked }` object for key/lock doors
- `playerStart` — `{x, y}` spawn position
- `enemies` — `[{ type, x, y }]`
- `shops` — `[{ type, x, y }]` (types: `general_store`, `gear_shop`, `spell_shop`, `underworld_shop`)
- `chests` — `[{ x, y, loot: [{ itemId, qty }], gold }]`
- `npcs` — `[{ npcId, x, y }]`
- `campfires` — `[{ x, y }]`
- `safe` — boolean (towns reset danger meter)
- `fixedEnemies` — boolean (use exact enemy types from room JSON instead of level-scaled spawns)

### Entity Interaction
Bump-to-interact: `tryMove()` in `player.js` checks destination tile for shops, NPCs, campfires, chests, enemies. Returns `{ type: 'combat'|'shop'|'npc'|'campfire'|'chest' }`. `main.js` handles the result.

### Combat System
Tick-based timeline: `ticksToAct = floor(80/SPD)`. Faster entities act more frequently. 8 upcoming turns pre-computed and displayed.

**Boss fights:** Boss AI dispatched from `boss-ai.js` via `executeBossTurn()`. Bosses have HP-threshold phases, weighted ability selection with cooldowns, submerge (untargetable) state, and can summon minions. Target cycling (left/right arrows) lets player choose between boss and minions. Boss definitions in `BOSS_DEFS` table.

Key formulas:
- Player attack: `max(1, ATK + weaponPower + rand(0-4) - 2 - enemyDEF) × resistMult × exploitMult × critMult`
- Enemy attack: `max(1, enemyATK - playerDEF) + 1 + floor(rand × 4)`
- Defend: 35% DR (regular), 50% DR (Bruiser Flex)
- Crit: base 5% + 0.5% per LCK, ×1.75 damage
- Flee: always succeeds, costs 10% gold

### Save System
Auto-saves to localStorage after each movement. Key: `gridlock_save_v1`. Saves full player state including materials, quests, perks, compendium, danger, recipes, equipment (as item IDs), difficulty, playtime, bossesDefeated.

3. Ensure required materials exist in `js/data/materials.js`

## Important Notes

- **No build step** — serve directory, open in browser
- **No npm** — do not create package.json or suggest installing packages
- **INT stat** — boosts Hacker ability damage and spell scaling (not Bruiser/Fixer abilities)
- **Abilities are free** — no MP cost. Balance comes from enemy pressure, not resource management
- **Equipment serialization** — save stores equipment as `{ id }` refs, rehydrated from `ITEMS` on load
- **Danger meter** — increments on room transitions (+1) and combat (+2/+5), resets in safe rooms, reduced by campfires (-15)
- **Death flow** — defeat → death screen → underworld/gate → pay fee (level×10 gold) or fight Marvin or grind ghost interns → revive at last safe room with full heal
- **Perk selection** — triggers after combat victory if player leveled to a perk milestone (5, 10, 15…50). Cannot be skipped.
- **Recipe discovery** — recipes appear in crafting UI when player has ≥1 of any required material
- **Compendium** — resistance revealed per-element on hit. Full reveal at 5 kills. Classified notes unlock at 100% region discovery.
- **Difficulty scaling** — enemies.js applies a difficulty multiplier (0.75/1.0/1.5) to enemy HP/ATK/DEF on spawn
- **Roaming enemies** — in non-safe rooms, each player move has a 12% chance to spawn a random enemy ≥4 tiles away (max 3 alive). Roaming enemies chase the player 1 tile per move via greedy Manhattan pathfinding. Walking into one or it reaching you triggers combat. Static (room-defined) enemies never move. Roaming enemies scale with player level via `resolveEnemyType()`. The `roaming: true` flag on the enemy object distinguishes them from static enemies.
- **Key/lock doors** — exits can be `{ target, locked: "key_item_id" }`, checked against player inventory in world.js
- **Boss tracking** — `player.bossesDefeated` array tracks bossId strings; quest flags set as `boss_{bossId}_defeated`
- **Ending trigger** — Mayor NPC with 5 NFT drives + Consultant defeated → ending sequence with princess-count variants
- **Audio** — Web Audio API, lazy-initialized on first user interaction. All SFX are synthesized (no audio files).
- `debug-ui.js` is a temporary playtesting tool. Remove before release.
